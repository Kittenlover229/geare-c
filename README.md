# Geare
Geare is a C header-only framework for pixelated graphics rendering.

## Installation
Don't just yet! It's a WIP after all.

## Usage
Not like I can tell you how to use it, so just hop and have a look at the [sandbox](./sandbox/main.c).

## Contributing
I appreciate the will, but hold just untill it releases as an alpha.
